Features: 
- +12V Supply Voltage
- +10V Gate Outputs with indication LEDs
- Custom tempo control between 60 - 160 BPM via rotary encoder 
- Auto/Manual modes via switches
- Inbuilt clock divider with multiple division programs such as odd numbers, prime numbers, Fibonacci sequence etc allowing for wild rhythms that couldn't be achieved with a standard clock divider
- Uses standard "off-the-shelf" components (TM1637 4-Digit display can be found for a cheap price on AliExpress)
